# Spam Classifier

In this code, you will find the training/testing process of Spam Classifier using Naive Bayes. 

Kaggle Dataset : [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)

To utilize the trained model, I developed a web app using Flask, where you can enter and verify whether the mail is SPAM OR NOT!
